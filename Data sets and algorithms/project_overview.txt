DATA SOURCE


The dataset used in this project is the "Adult Income" dataset,
publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult

The original dataset contains information about individuals such as age,
education, occupation, and income. It is commonly used to evaluate fairness
and bias in machine learning models.

!!! The dataset is used here strictly for educational and research purposes.


PROJECT FILE EXPLANATION


1. adult_combined.csv
   - The cleaned and merged dataset used for training and testing.
   - Created from the original UCI Adult dataset.

2. data_cleaning.py
   - Contains functions to load, clean, and preprocess the data.
   - Converts categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
   - Can be reused for other datasets with similar structure.

3. model_training.py
   - Main script that trains 4 models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM).
   - Evaluates each model’s accuracy.
   - Performs a fairness analysis (by gender) using the Random Forest model.

4. requirements.txt
   - Contains all required Python packages to run the project.
   - Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Screenshot or Graph (optional - assets folder)
   - Visualization of fairness metrics (accuracy, selection rate, TPR, FPR) per gender.

NOTE:
- Run model_training.py as the main script to execute the full pipeline.
- Requires Python 3.8+ and packages listed in requirements.txt
